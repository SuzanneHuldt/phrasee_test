# phrasee_test

### quickstart guide
in the project directory:
- run ``npm init``
- run ``npm install``
- run ``node index.js``

- go to localhost:8080
- the interface with the algorithm is from the url only: please enter the required post id in the form localhost:8080/id
- the program will print the grouped notifications to the browser

### notes
the class Grouper contains the algorithm that sorts the notifications into groups. for the convenience of the user (and my own amusement!) i also wrote a class PrettyPrinter that prepares the grouped content for easy and clear printing to the screen.

detailed comments are given throughout the code.
